S"<p>What kind of god would you be? Benevolent or vengeful? Play Pocket God and discover the answer within yourself. On a remote island, you are the all-powerful god that rules over the primitive islanders. You can bring new life, and then take it away just as quickly. Exercise your powers on the islanders. Lift them in the air, alter gravity, hit them with lightning...you're the island god! All god powers are demonstrated in Pocket God's help menu.<br/><br/>Pocket God is an episodic microgame for you to explore, show your friends and have fun with. We have been growing the game with the help of player suggestions!  What sort of godly powers would you like to see added?<br/><br/>More info can be found at our blog and Facebook page.<br/><br/>http://pocketgod.blogspot.com<br/><br/>http://www.facebook.com/pages/Pocket-God/49506746358<br/><br/><br/><br/>Releases:<br/><br/>Ep 1: Nowhere To Go, Nothin' To Do <br/>Ep 2: Does this Megabyte Make My App Look Fat?<br/>Ep 3: You Always Hurt the One You Lava <br/>Ep 4: Shake That App!<br/>Ep 5: A Storm is Coming<br/>Ep 6: And on the 7th Day, Rest!<br/>Ep 7: Just Give Us 5 Minutes<br/>Ep 8: Jump the Shark<br/>Ep 9: Idle Hands<br/>Ep 10: Hi, Dracula!<br/>Ep 11: A Mighty Wind<br/>Ep 12: Something's Fishy\xe2\x80\xa6<br/>Ep 13: March of the Fire Ants<br/>Ep 14: Say My Name!<br/>Ep 15: A New Home<br/>Ep 16: The Tyrannosaurus Strikes Back!<br/>Ep 17: Return of the Pygmy<br/>Ep 18: Surf's Up<br/>Ep 19: Fun 'n Games Until A Pygmy Gets Hurt<br/>Ep 20: Stop!
